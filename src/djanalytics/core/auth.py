'''
This allows djanalytics to have authentication on provided URLs. 

All views are decorated with the @auth decorator. 

The @auth decorator looks at settings.py for a DJA_AUTH setting. The
DJA_AUTH setting maps function names to authentication decorators. For
example, to require all djanalytics URLs to have a login, add the
following to settings.py:

import django.contrib.auth.decorators
DJA_AUTH = { '.*' : django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required } 

The goal of this is to, for example, be able to add login_required for
views, but some kind of secret key authentication for queries, and
similar. This code has not been integration-tested yet (although it is
likely to be by the time you read this).
